## Overview

I built a superhero app that allows a user to search for their favorite superhero.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for their favorite hero.
- See the stats.

## My process

I built this app using React.js as my framework. Used a API to fetch data about superheros.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and animation
- Flexbox
- JSX
- ES6
- REST API
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

In future I may clone this repo and add some more functionality to it. I would like to add a feature to save a hero to a list or compare results.
